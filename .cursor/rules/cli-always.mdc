# Use CLI Always

When a command-line interface exists for a task, use it. Do not suggest manual steps or GUI workflows when the CLI can do the same thing.

- **Dependencies:** `npm install`, `npm run …`, not "open package manager" or manual downloads.
- **Database:** `npm run db:push`, `supabase …`, not only "run this in the SQL Editor" when a script or migration command exists.
- **Git:** After making changes, always commit and push: `git add`, `git commit`, `git push`. Do this at the end of the session or after a logical set of changes so the remote is up to date.
- **Build/lint:** `npm run build`, `npm run lint`, `npm run typecheck` (or equivalent), not "click Build" in the IDE.
- **Env:** Use `vercel env pull` or project scripts that read/write env, when documented.

Prefer running commands in the terminal (e.g. via the Shell tool) over instructing the user to do steps manually, unless the task genuinely requires manual action (e.g. first-time Supabase dashboard config for URLs).
